In this data project we aim to visually explore a dataset containing the exchange rates for the Euro (€) against other currencies. The dataset describes the daily Euro exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The Euro is the official currency of 19 of the 27 countries in the European Union and is used by 343 million people.

The Euro is both the second largest behind Pound Sterling (£) and the second most traded currency on the international markets after United States Dollar (UD$).

The data set can be found on Kaggle, it was collected by a user called Daria Chemkaeva from the European Central Bank. The dataset is often updated, so this analysis may need to be updated in the future.
